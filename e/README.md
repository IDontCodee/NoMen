# STOP!

Editing index.mjs is NOT HOW you configure this! You should use ENV variables

The variables to config are:



- `auth` - If auth is enabled. Can be `true` or `false`.
- `username` - The username if auth is enabled.
- `password` - The password if auth is enabled.
- `INVITE_URL` - The link for the discord button on the home page.
- `CHATBOX_URL` - The link for the chatbox.

#### Quick links to how to configure for:

- [Cloud Services](#Cloud-services)
- [Self hosting](#Self-host)

### Cloud-services

For Heroku, edit config vars from your appâ€™s `Settings` tab in the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

### Self-host


Self-hosting is a bit harder.

Find the file named `.env.example` and read the instructions inside.

Remember to copy the file and not rename the example file! If you rename the example file it will break everything!

Here is a example `.env` file filled out:

```
# If auth is enabled. Can be "true" or "false" . No quotes are needed
auth=false

# The username if auth is enabled. Double quotes are needed
username="username"

# The password if auth is enabled. Double quotes are needed
password="1234isabadpassword"

# The link for the discord button on the home page. Double quotes are needed
INVITE_URL="https://discord.gg"

# The link for the chatbox. Double quotes are needed
CHATBOX_URL="https://widgetbot.io"
```
